I'm building a archive/blog/testimonial/travel diary/...

## Tell me more..

All notes are stored in a *Zettelkasten* system. I'm using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to build and manage my knowledge portal. By using a simple folder structure, I'm trying to symplify the process of building a dedicated website attached to my *Zettelkasten*.
