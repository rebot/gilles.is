# Hello World :clap:

Hi, I'm telling you 'hello' from my new blog. This page is a basic `.mdx` file located in the `src/pages` folder and its subsequent subfolders. The choisc of the naming of the subfolders defines the routing of the website. 

## Coding  

What about syntax highlighting for code? The only requirement is to specify the language in your markdown file. Hereafter, a `python` code block is displayed.

```python 
import numpy as np

# In[0]: Hello World

x = np.linspace(0,10,2)
y = x**2 + 6
```

## Math

Ever tought about writing some formulas? We've got you covered. Using `Katex`, formulas (both `inline` and in `display`) written down in $\LaTeX$ are getting converted to `html`. 

If $x_{1} = 3$ and $x_{2} = 4$, then:

$$
x_{1}^2 + x_{2}^2 = 5^2
$$
