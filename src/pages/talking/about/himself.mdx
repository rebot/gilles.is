<Badge>about me</Badge>

Hi, my name is `Gilles`. I'm proud to be a `Belgian` :beers: ! I'm working as a `civil engineer`. In my spare time, I like to `hack` some small project together. These project have always been related with programming. More recently I also started to play around with microcontrollers, smart home devices, etc. 

Last but not least, I'm also a member of the notorious hackersquad `Eetietshekken` :sunglasses:
